## Welcome!
👋 We are excited to have you here. RunwayML aims to make machine learning (ML) techniques accessible to students, creative practitioners from a wide range of disciplines, and anyone curious about the topic. If this is your first time visiting RunwayML, start with our [installation guide](getting-started/installation). 

After installing RunwayML, learn how to browse and run machine learning models with our [introductory guide to using models](how-to/use-models)—no coding required. 

RunwayML also connects to a variety of [creative programming and design environments](networking/examples) and integrates with software applications as a [plugin](https://runwayml.com/integrations).

Interested in adding your own models to RunwayML? Please visit our [model importing guide](how-to/import-models).

You can also train your own models to [generate images](create/train-image-generation) and [identify objects in images](create/train-object-detection).

## What is Machine Learning?
🤖 Machine learning is an area of research within the field of artifical intelligence (AI). RunwayML is a platform for publishing open source, pre-trained machine learning models, as well as for training your own models. The term model refers to the result of training a machine learning algorithm with a dataset. A machine learning algorithm find patterns within the data and develops its own rules for how to represent—or model—those patterns to perform a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans; they are learned from the data on which the model was trained.

People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks, and for different purposes, such as to recognize spam email, classify objects, edit images and video, and capture motion. There are models that generate photorealistic faces, image captions, streets, building facades, human voices, and produce videos of airplanes morphing into cats. Some models detect cancer, malaria, and HIV.

It is important to note that models are trained on the data given to them, which means that they incorporate the biases of that data. For creators who build datasets from their own work, machine learning provides ways to augment and extend their creative practices. But some trained models are ethically dubious and raise important questions about the social impact of algorithms in our society, such as models used to screen job applicants or to predict crime. 

Reality is complex, and a model will never completely mimic real phenomena. As you venture down the exciting path of machine learning, keep in mind the famous words of the great statistician George Box: "[All models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)".

## Beta Software
RunwayML is public beta software, which means that we are actively developing the application. Expect features and documentation to change often. 

👂**We want to hear from you!** We aim to build inclusive and accessible tools, and we need to hear from everyone. While we are actively developing RunwayML, we think is important to listen and understand from our users as often as we can. Please leave us a note, feedback, or suggestion via [Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack) or email us at [feedback@runwayml.com](mailto:feedback@runwayml.com) 

## Education Program
📚 We invite educators to join our pilot education program to provide students with the next generation of creative tools. Learn more and connect with us [here](https://runwayml.com/educators).

## Join Our Community
🌏 RunwayML has an active community of creators and contributors on [Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/runwayml), and [GitHub](https://github.com/runwayml).

We encourage everyone to:

* Share your [projects](https://runwayml.com/madewith/)
* Learn more about the creative applications of machine learning
* Contribute tutorials, extensions, and models
* Shape the future of RunwayML
* Form collaborations
* Get involved by attending and/or running workshops

## Contribute
💻 **Open Source Development**: RunwayML allows you to connect state-of-the-art machine learning models to third-party applications via open source extensions, plugins, libraries, and add-ons. If you want to contribute to RunwayML's development, you can create and share your extensions and models with the RunwayML community. The official and supported open source software projects can be found in our [GitHub account](https://github.com/runwayml).

Examples, demos, and tutorials are also welcome!

## Code of Conduct
🌈 Our Code of Conduct (CoC) at RunwayML aims to ensure we create an inclusive, diverse, and harassment-free community. 

As a result, we promote:

* Kindness
* Equality
* Respect

This code of conduct applies to both online platforms and in-person experiences. If you find you are a victim, or witness any form of harassment, alert a RunwayML organizer immediately or please contact us to [report the incident](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFaYn-dBkCJ9hRcrCktw1XfqgE8Gf5fu6XnK9FUBIV36iBnQ/viewform).
